# 2. Terminal and Bash
Hi Everyone! Welcome to the lecture/module on Terminal and Bash.
You will see Jupyter Notebooks and PDFs for the content and exercises, and a couple of directories that hold the resources for them.
The material is originally by Sebastian Urchs from our lab, but he is teaching another module this year, so you are stuck with me (Jacob) as your lecturer. If you check out the QLS-612 YouTube channel you can see his original delivery of the lecture too :) .
Enjoy!
