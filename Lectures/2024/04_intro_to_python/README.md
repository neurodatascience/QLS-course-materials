# Introduction to Python

**Instructor:** Jacob

Welcome to **Module 3: Introduction to Python**! 🐍

In this module, we will cover the fundamentals of the Python programming language:
syntax, data structures, functions, and more.

Lecture material (an interactive notebook) can be found in `lecture`,
and I have posted tutorial exercises in the `exercises` folder.
Exercise solutions will be posted at a later date in the course.

All the material for this module is modified from last year's version of the course,
where the module was taught by Jacob Sanz-Robinson.

## Pre-recorded lecture

A pre-recorded lecture (taught by Jacob) covering mostly the same material
can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ml6VkmtLXpA).
