Angels' Choir: [Sort of a Chant to the Star of Bethlehem]
Brian: Uhuhlk!
Gaspar: Hrmhrm!
Mother falling off stool: [Crash]
Mother: Uhooh! Who are you?
Gaspar: We are three wise men.
Mother: What?
Melchior: We are three wise men.
Mother: Well, what are you doing creeping under a couch at two o'clock in the morning? That doesn't sound very wise to me.
Balthasar: We are astrologists.
Melchior: We have come from the East.
Mother: Is this some kind of joke?
Gaspar: We wish to praise the infant.
Melchior: We must pay a homage to him.
Mother: Homage? You're all drunk! It's disgusting! Out! Come on, out!
Gaspar: No...
Mother: Barge in here with tales about all the ancient fortune-tellers. Come on, out!
Gaspar: No, no, we must see him!
Mother: Go and praise someone else's brat! Go on!
Melchior: We...we were led by a star!
Mother: Led by a bottle more like! Go on, out!
Melchior: Well, well, we must see him, we have brought presents!
Mother: Out!
Gaspar: Gold, frankincense, myrrh!
Mother: Well, why didn't you say? He's over there. Sorry the place is a...bit of a mess. Well, what is myrrh anyway?
Balthasar: It is a valuable balm.
Mother: A balm?! What are you giving him a balm for? It might bite him!
Balthasar: What?
Mother: That's a dangerous animal! Quick, throw it in the trough!
Melchior: No, it isn't!
Mother: Yes, it is! It's great big uhug...
Gaspar: No, no, no, it is an ointment.
Mother: Oh, well, there is an animal called a balm, or did I dream it? So you're astrologists, are you? Well, what is he then?
Gaspar: Hm?
Mother: What star-sign is he?
Gaspar: Ehm...capricorn.
Mother: Ah, capricorn, eh? What are they like?
Gaspar: Oh, well, he's the son of God, ah, Messiah.
Melchior: King of the Jews!
Mother: And that's capricorn, is it?
Gaspar: Ehm, no, no, no, that's just him!
Mother: Oh, that's good to say, otherwise there'd be a lot of them. Snhff.
Melchior: By what name are you calling him?
Mother: Uhm, Brian.
All three wise men: We worship you, oh Brian, who are lord over us all. Praise unto you, Brian, and to the Lord, our
father. Amen.
Mother: Do you do a lot of this, then?
Gaspar: What?
Mother: This praising.
Gaspar: No, no...no, no.
Mother: Oh, well, ehm, if you're dropping by again, do pop in, huh. And thanks a lot for the gold and frankincense, ahm, but
don't worry too much about the myrrh the next time, all right? Huh. Thank you! Goodbye!
Hen: Gdisk!
Mother: Well, were they nice? Hm! Out of their bloody minds, but still, look at that! Hohoho...hear! Hear! Here, that...that's
mine! Hey! Hey, you could hate me, hey! Ourrgh!

Female Singer:
Brian, the babe they called Brian,
he grew, he grew, and grew,
grew up to be, grew up to be,
a boy called Brian. A boy called Brian,
he had arms, and legs, and head, and feet,
the boy, whose name was Brian.

Man sleeping on cloud falling: Aaargh!

Female Singer:
And he grew, he grew, grew, and grew,
grew up to be, yes, he grew up to be,
yes, his name was Brian, a teenager called Brian.
And his face became spotty, yes, his face became spotty,
and his voice dropped down low,
and things started to grow, on young Brian and so,
he was certainly no, no girl named Brian,
not a girl named Brian.

And he started to shave, and have one the wrist,
and want to see girls, and go out and get pissed,
a man called Brian, this man called Brian,
the man they called Brian, this man called Briaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...

SATURDAY AFTERNOON

ABOUT TEA TIME

Jesus Christ: How blessed are those who know that he's of God. How blessed are the sorrowful; they shall find consolation.
How blessed are those of gentle spirit; they shall have the earth for their possession. How blessed are those who hunger and
thirst to see right prevail; they shall be satisfied. How blessed are those whose hearts are pure; they shall see God.
Mother: Speak up!
Brian: Sch, quiet, mum!
Mother: Well, I can't hear a thing. Let's go to stoning!
Bignose: Ssch!
Brian: You can go to a stoning anytime!
Mother: Ah, come on, Brian!
Bignose: Will you be quiet!
Bignose's Wife: Don't pick your nose!
Bignose: I wasn't picking my nose. I was scratching it.
Bignose's Wife: You was picking it while you was talking to that lady!
Bignose: I wasn't!
Bignose's Wife: Leave it alone! Give it a rest!
Wiseguy: Do you mind, I can't hear a word he's saying.
Bignose's Wife: Don't you "do you mind" me! I was talking to my husband!
Wiseguy: Well, can't you talk to him somewhere else? I can't hear a bloody thing!
Bignose: Don't you swear at my wife!
Wiseguy: Well, I was only asking her to shut up so that I can hear what he's saying, Bignose!
Bignose's Wife: Don't you call my husband "Bignose"!
Bignose: Well, he has got a big nose.
Bearded Man: Could you be quiet, please? What was that?
Wiseguy: I don't know, I was too busy talking to Bignose!
Spectator I: I think it was "Blessed are the cheesemakers".
Bearded Man's Wife: Aha, what's so special about the cheesemakers?
Bearded Man: Well, obviously it's not meant to be taken literally; it refers to any manufacturers of dairy products.
Wiseguy: See, if you hadn't been going on we'd have heard that, Bignose.
Bignose: Hey, say that once more, I'll smash your bloody face in!
Wiseguy: Oh, better keep listening, might be a bit about "Blessed are the Bignoses".
Brian: Oh, lay off him!
Wiseguy: Oh, you're not so bad yourself, conkface. Where are you two from? Nose City?
Wiseguy: One more time, mate, I'll take you to fucking cleaners!
Bignose's Wife: Language! And don't pick your nose!
Bignose: I wasn't going to pick my nose! I'm gonna thump him!
Spectator II: Hear that, blessed are the Greek!
Bearded Man: The Greek?
Spectator II: Hmm. Well, apparently he's going to inherit the earth.
Bearded Man: Did anyone catch his name?
Bignose's Wife: You're not gonna thump anybody!
Bignose: I'll thump him if he calls me "Bignose" again!
Wiseguy: Oh, shut up, Bignose!
Bignose: Ha, right! I warned you! I really will slug you! Saaah...
Bignose's Wife: Oh, it's the meek! Blessed are the meek! Oh, that's nice, innit? I'm glad they're getting something because they
had a hell of a time.
Wiseguy: Listen, I'm only telling the truth, you have got a very big nose!
Bignose: Hey, your nose is going to be three foot wide across your face by the time I'm finished with you!
Spectator I & Spectator II: Ssch!
Wiseguy: Well, who hit yours then? Goliath's big brother?
Bignose: All right, that's your last warning!
Bearded Man's Wife: Oh, do quiet down!
Bignose hitting Bearded Man's Wife: [Thump]
Bearded Man's Wife: Aiih!
Bignose: Silly bitch, getting in the way!
Bearded Man: Aaargh!
Bignose: Racket all the way...
Mother: Oh, come on, let's go to the stoning!
Brian: All right.
Rogers: Well, blessed is just about everyone with a fested interest in the status quo, if I'm right with you there, Reg?
Reg: Yeah, well, what Jesus quietly fails to appreciate is that it's the meek who're the problem.
Judith: Yes, yes, absolutely Reg, yes, I see!
Mother: Oh, come on, Brian, or they'll have him stoned before we get there.
Brian: All right.
Bignose: Aaargh!
Bearded Man's Wife: Lay off!
Wiseguy: Hey, don't be there, he's just lying there, Bignose. Stop that, there's a rape going on, frankly speaking, it's he that
started it all...

Mother: Ah, how I hate wearing these beards.
Brian: Why aren't women allowed to go to stonings, mum?
Mother: It's written, that's why.
Beard and stone seller: Pssst! Beard, madam?
Woman carrying donkey: Oh, look, I haven't got the time to go to no stonings. He's not well again.
Donkey: Oink! Oink!
Beard and stone seller: Stone, sir?
Mother: No, they've got a lot there, lying around on the ground.
Beard and stone seller: Oh, not like these, sir. Look at this! Feel the quality of that, that's craftmanship, sir.
Mother: Hmm...all right, we'll have two with points and...a big flat one.
Brian: Could I have a flat one, mum?
Mother: Ssch!
Brian: Sorry! Dad!
Mother: Ehm...all right, two points, ahm...two flats and a packet of gravel.
Beard and stone seller: Packet of gravel. Should be a good one this afternoon.
Mother: Hm?
Beard and stone seller: Local boy.
Mother: Oh, good.
Beard and stone seller: Enjoy yourselves!
Women disguised as bearded men: [Scream] [Yell]
Bird: Fuiit!
Priest: Matthias, son of Deuteronomy of Gath...
Matthias: Do I say yes?
Guard: Yes.
Matthias: Yes!
Priest: ...you have been found guilty by the elders of the town of uttering the name of our Lord, and so as a blasphemer...
Women disguised as bearded men: Ooh...
Priest: ...you are to be stoned to death!
Women disguised as bearded men: Aah!
Matthias: Look, I'd had a lovely supper, and all I said to my wife was: "That piece of halibut was good enough for Jehova!".
Women disguised as bearded men: Oooh!
Priest: Blasphemy! He said it again!
Women disguised as bearded men: Yeah! Yes! Yes!
Priest: Did you hear him?!
Women disguised as bearded men: Yeah! Yes! Yes!
Woman: Really!
Priest: Are there any women here today?
Women disguised as bearded men: Uh...ooh...no...
Priest: Very well. By virtue of the authority vested in me...
Rock thrown at Matthias: [Bladonk]
Women disguised as bearded men: Ooh...
Matthias: Oh, lay off! We haven't started yet!
Priest: Come on! Who threw that? Who threw that stone? Come on!
Women disguised as bearded men: She did! She did! He did! He did! He did!
Woman: Sorry, I thought we'd started.
Priest: Go to the back!
Woman: Oh, dear...
Priest: Always one, isn't there? Now, where were we?
Matthias: Look, I don't think it ought to be blasphemy, just saying "Jehova"!
Women disguised as bearded men: Aiiih! He did!
Priest: You're only making it worse for yourself!
Matthias: Making it worse? How could it be worse? Jehova, Jehova, Jehova!
Women disguised as bearded men: Aiiih!
Priest: I'm warning you! If you say Jehova once more...
Rock thrown at Priest: [Bladonk]
Priest: Right! Who threw that?
Matthias: Hehehe...
Priest: Come on! Who threw that?
Women disguised as bearded men: She did! She did! She did! Him! Him! Him!
Priest: Was it you?
Woman II: Yes.
Priest: Right...
Woman II: Well, you did say Jehova!
Women disguised as bearded men: Aiiih!
Rocks thrown at Woman II: [Multiple Bladonks]
Priest: Stop! Stop! Will you stop that! Stop it! Now, look! No one is to stone anyone until I blow this whistle! Do you
understand? Even, and I want to make this absolutely clear, even if they do say Jehova!
Women disguised as bearded men: Aiiih!
Rocks thrown at Priest: [Multiple Bladonks]
Priest: Aaargh!
Large boulder crushing Priest: [Bladonk]
Woman III: Good shot!
Women disguised as bearded men: [Applause]

Brian: Have I got a big nose, mum?
Mother: Oh, stop thinking about sex!
Brian: I wasn't!
Mother: You're always on about it. Morning, noon and night: "Will the girls like this, will the girls like that? Is it too big, is it
too small?"
Leper I: A fish, sir?
Leper II: Alms for a leper!
Leper III: Alms for a leper!
Ex-leper: Alms for an ex-leper! Bloody donkey-owners, all the same, ain't they? Never have any change. Oh, here they...
touch! Spare a talent for an old ex-leper!
Mother: Buzz off!
Ex-leper: Spare a talent for an old ex-leper!
Mother: A talent? That's more than he earns in a month!
Ex-leper: Half a talent then?
Mother: No, get away!
Ex-leper: Come on Bignose, let's haggle!
Brian: What?
Ex-leper: All right, cut the haggling, let's say you open at one shekel, I start at 2000, we close at about 1800.
Brian: No.
Ex-leper: 1750?
Mother: Go away!
Ex-leper: 1740?
Mother: Look, will you leave him alone!
Ex-leper: All right. Two shekels, just two. Isn't this fun, eh?
Mother: Look, he is not giving you any money, so piss off!
Ex-leper: All right sir, my final offer, half a shekel for an old ex-leper?
Brian: Did you say ex-leper?
Ex-leper: That's right, sir. Sixteen years behind a bell and fradock, sir.
Brian: Oh...what happened?
Ex-leper: I was cured, sir.
Brian: Cured?
Ex-leper: Yes, a bloody miracle, sir. God bless you!
Brian: Oh, who cured you?
Ex-leper: Jesus did, sir. I was hopping along, minding my own business, all of a sudden up he comes, cures me. One minute
I'm a leper with a trade, next minute I'm alive and newsgone. Not so much as a bye or league! "You're cured, mate". Bloody
do-gooder.
Brian: Tough. Why don't you go and tell him that you want to be a leper again?
Ex-leper: Aah, I could do that sir, yeah. Yeah, I could do that, I suppose. Well, what the thing was I was going to ask him if
he'd make me a bit lame in one leg during the middle of the week. You know, something peckable but not leprosy, which is a
pain in the ass, to be blunt despute my French servant.
Mother: Brian! Come and clean your room out!
Brian: Here you are.
Ex-leper: Thank you, sir. Than...half a dinare for me bloody life story?
Brian: There's no pleasing some people.
Ex-leper: That's just what Jesus said, sir!
Door being kicked in by mother: [Bladonk]
Mother: Oh.
Roman Officer: Good afternoon.
Mother: Oh, eh...hello, officer, ehrm...I'll be with you in a few moments, all right with you?
Brian: What's he doing here?
Mother: Ehm...ah, don't start that Brian, ehm...go and clean your room out.
Brian: The bloody Romans!
Mother: Now, look Brian! If it wasn't for them, we wouldn't have all this. And don't you forget it.
Brian: We don't owe the Romans anything, mum.
Mother: Oh, that's not entirely true, is it, Brian?
Brian: What do you mean?
Mother: Well...you know when you were asking me about your...
Brian: My nose?
Mother: Yes, well...there's a reason it's like it is, Brian.
Brian: What is it?
Mother: Oh, well, I suppose I should have told you a long time ago, but...
Brian: What?
Mother: Well, Brian, your father isn't Mr. Cohen.
Brian: I never thought he was!
Mother: Now none of your cheek! He was a Roman, Brian. He was a centurion in the Roman army.
Brian: You mean...you were raped?!
Mother: Well...at first, yes.
Brian: Who was it?
Mother: Huh...Naughtius Maximus his name was. Hmm...promised me the known world, he did. I was to be taken to Rome,
house by the Forums, slaves, asses' milk, as much gold as I could eat. Then he, having his way with me he had; voom! Like a
rat out of an aqueduct.
Brian: He's a bastard!
Mother: Yes, and next time you go on about the "bloody Romans", don't forget you're one of them.
Brian: I'm not a Roman mum, and I never will be. I'm a kike, a jid, a heebe, a hooknose! I'm kosher, mum! I'm a red-sea
pedestrian and proud of it!
Brian closing door: [Bladonk]
Mother: Huh...sex, sex, sex, that's all they think about, eh? Hm. Well, how are you then, officer?

SPQR DIVO AVGVSTO CAESARI

THE COLOSSEUM, JERUSALEM

CHILDREN'S MATINEE

Speaker's Voice: Ladies and gentlemen! The next contest is between: Frank the Loyal, the Macedonian baby smacker, and
Boris Fineburn.
Brian: Ah, right, thank you, madam. Lark's tongues! Wren's livers! Chaffinch's brains! Jaguar's earlobes! Wolve's nibble chips!
Get them while they're off, they're lovely. Dromedary pretzel verily after dinner! Tuscany fried bats!
Judith: I do feel Reg, that any anti-imperialistic group like ours must reflect such a divergence of interest within its
powerbase.
Reg: Agreed. Rogers?
Rogers: Yes, I think Judith's point of view is very valid, Reg, provided the movement never forgets that it is the unalienable
right of every man...
Stan: Or woman.
Rogers: ...or woman to rid himself...
Stan: Or herself.
Rogers: ...or herself...
Reg: Agreed.
Rogers: Thank you, brother.
Stan: Or sister.
Rogers: Or sister...where was I?
Reg: I think you'd finished.
Rogers: Oh. Right.
Reg: Further more, it it the birthright of every man...
Stan: Or woman.
Reg: Why don't you shut up about women, Stan? You're putting us off.
Stan: Women have a perfect right to play a part in our movement, Reg.
Rogers: Why are you always on about women, Stan?
Stan: I want to be one.
Reg: What?
Stan: I want to be a woman. From now on, I want you all to call me Loretta.
Reg: What?
Loretta: It's my right as a man.
Judith: Well, why do you want to be Loretta, Stan?
Loretta: I want to have babies.
Reg: You want to have babies?!
Loretta: It's every man's right to have babies if he wants them.
Reg: But...you can't have babies!
Loretta: Don't you opress me!
Reg: I'm not opressing you, Stan. You haven't got a womb. Where is the foetus going to gestate? You're going to keep it in a
box?
Loretta: Sniff.
Judith: Here, I've got an idea. Suppose you agree that he can't actually have babies, not having a womb, which is nobody's
fault, not even the Romans', but that he can have the right to have babies.
Rogers: Good idea, Judith. We shall fight the oppressors for your right to have babies, brother. Sister! Sorry.
Reg: What's the point?
Rogers: What?
Reg: What's the point of fighting for his right to have babies, when he can't have babies?
Rogers: It is symbolic of our struggle against opression.
Reg: Symbolic of his struggle against reality.
Trumpets: [Fanfares]
Audience: [Applause]
Guard: Get out there! Ah, get out there!
Victim: It's dangerous out there! Aah! Aiih! Oh.
Audience: Aah...come on! Ooh... Out a lot of garbage.
Brian: Lark's tongues! Otter's noses! Ozelot spleens!
Reg: Got any nuts?
Brian: Haven't got any nuts, sorry. I've got wren's livers, badger spleens...
Reg: No, no, no...
Brian: Otters' noses?
Reg: I don't want any of that Roman rubbish!
Judith: Why don't you sell proper food?
Brian: Proper food?
Reg: Yeah, not those rich imperialist tippets!
Brian: Oh, don't blame me, I didn't ask to sell this stuff!
Reg: All right, bag of otter's noses, then.
Rogers: Make it two.
Reg: Two.
Rogers: Thanks, Reg.
Brian: Are you the Judean People's Front?
Reg: Fuck off!
Brian: What?
Reg: Judean People's Front! We're The People's Front of Judea! Judean People's Front, God!
Rogers: Blighters...
Brian: Can I...join your group?
Reg: No, piss off!
Brian: I didn't want to sell this stufff, it's only a job! I hate the Romans as much as anybody!
All in PFJ except Brian: Ssch! Ssch! Ssch! Ssch! Ssch!
Brian: Oh.
Judith: Are you sure?
Brian: Oh, dead sure. I hate the Romans already.
Reg: Listen! If you wanted to join the PFJ, you'd have to have really hate the Romans.
Brian: I do!
Reg: Oh, yeah, how much?
Brian: A lot!
Reg: Right, you're in. Listen, the only people we hate more than the Romans, are the fucking Judean People's Front.
All in PFJ except Brian: Yeah!
Judith: Splitters!
Rogers: And the Judean Popular People's Front!
All in PFJ except Brian: Yeah! Splitters!
Loretta: And the People's Front of Judea!
All in PFJ except Brian: Yeah! Splitters!
Reg: What?
Loretta: The People's Front of Judea. Splitters!
Reg: We are the People's Front of Judea!
Loretta: Oh. I thought we were the Popular Front.
Reg: People's Front! God...
Rogers: Whatever happened to the Popular Front, Reg?
Reg: He's over there.
All in PFJ except Brian: Splitter!
Gladiator: Oh, oh...I think I'm about to have a cardiac arrest! Ooh...aah!
Roman I: Absolutely dreadful!
Roman II: Huh.
Audience: [Applause]
Reg: Peace, brother! Haha! What's your name?
Brian: Brian. Brian...Cohen.
Reg: We may have a little job for you, Brian.

Centurion: What's this then? Romanes eunt domus? People call around marnays they go the house?
Brian: It...it says: "Romans go home."
Centurion: No, it doesn't.
Brian: Aih.
Centurion: What's Latin for Romans? Come on!
Brian: Aih! Aah! Romanus!
Centurion: Goes like...?
Brian: Anis?
Centurion: Vocative plural of anis is...?
Brian: Ani?
Centurion: Romani...Eunt? What is eunt?
Brian: "Go"! De...
Centurion: Conjugate the verb "go"!
Brian: Aah...ere, eo, is, it, imus, itis, eunt.
Centurion: So eunt is...?
Brian: Aah, ehm...third person plural present indicative. Ehm..."they go".
Centurion: But "Romans go home" is an order, so you must use the...?
Brian: Aih! Imperative!
Centurion: Which is...?
Brian: Ehm, oh...oh, ehm...i, i!
Centurion: How many Romans?
Brian: Aah! it's...plural, plural! Ite! Ite!

Aah, ooh!
Centurion: Except that domus takes the...?
Brian: Aah! The locative, sir! Aah!
Centurion: Which is...?
Brian: Domum! Aah, ah, aah...
Centurion: Domum...um. Understand?
Brian: Yes, sir!
Centurion: Now, write that a hundred times!
Brian: Yes, sir! Thank you, sir! Hail Caesar, sir!
Centurion: Hail Caesar! And if it's not done by sunrise, I'll cut your balls off.
Brian: Oh, thank you, sir! Thank you, sir! Hail Caesar and everything, sir! Aah. Mmh! Aah... Finished! Aah.
Roman Soldier: Right. Now, don't do it again!
Man with bag: Hey! Bloody Romans...

Rogers: We get in through the underground heating-system here ,up through an inamane audience chamber here, and Pilate's
wife's bedroom is here. Having grabbed his wife, we inform Pilate that she is in our custody, and fore with issue our demands.
Any questions?
Revolutionary I: What exactly are the demands?
Reg: We're giving Pilate two days to dismantle the entire apparatus of the Roman imperialist state, and if he doesn't agree
immediately, we execute her.
Matthias: Cut her head off?
Rogers: Cut all her bits off! Send them back on the hour, every hour! Seldom why not to be tried for it.
Reg: And of course, we point out that they bear full responsibility when we chop her up, and that we shall not submit to
blackmale.
All revolutionaries except Reg: No blackmale!
Reg: They bled us white, the bastards. They've taken everything we had. And not just from us! From our fathers, and from
our father's fathers.
Loretta: And from our father's father's fathers.
Reg: Yeah.
Loretta: And from our father's father's father's fathers.
Reg: Yeah, all right Stan, don't delay with the point. And what have they ever given us in return?
Revolutionary I: The aqueduct?
Reg: What?
Revolutionary I: The aqueduct.
Reg: Oh. Yeah, yeah, they did give us that, ah, that's true, yeah.
Revolutionary II: And the sanitation.
Loretta: Oh, yeah, the sanitation, Reg. Remember what the city used to be like.
Reg: Yeah, all right, I'll grant you the aqueduct and sanitation, the two things the Romans have done.
Matthias: And the roads.
Reg: Oh, yeah, obviously the roads. I mean the roads go without saying, don't they? But apart from the sanitation, the
aqueduct, and the roads...
Revolutionary III: Irrigation.
Revolutionary I: Medicine.
Revolutionary IV: Education.
Reg: Yeah, yeah, all right, fair enough.
Revolutionary V: And the wine.
All revolutionaries except Reg: Oh, yeah! Right!
Rogers: Yeah! Yeah, that's something we'd really miss Reg, if the Romans left. Huh.
Revolutionary VI: Public bathes.
Loretta: And it's safe to walk in the streets at night now, Reg.
Rogers: Yeah, they certainly know how to keep order. Let's face it; they're the only ones who could in a place like this.
All revolutionaries except Reg: Hahaha...all right...
Reg: All right, but apart from the sanitation, the medicine, education, wine, public order, irrigation, roads, the fresh-water
system and public health, what have the Romans ever done for us?
Revolutionary I: Brought peace?
Reg: Oh, peace! Shut up!
Judith: [Knock] [Knock] [Knock] [Knock] [Knock] [Knock] [Knock] ... [Knock] [Knock] [Knock] [Knock] [Knock]
Matthias: I'm a poor man, my sight is sore, my legs are old and bented.
Judith: All right, Matthias.
Matthias: It's all clear.
Judith: Well, where's Reg?
Rogers: Oh, Reg! Reg! Judith!
Reg: What went wrong?
Judith: The first blow has been struck!
Reg: Did he finish the slogan?
Judith: A hundred times! In letters ten foot high, all the way around the palace!
Reg: Oh, great! Great! We...we need doers in our movement Brian, but...before you join us, know this: there is not one of us
here who would not gladly suffer death to rid this country the Romans once and for all.
Revolutionary VII: Ehm...well, one.
Reg: Oh, yeah. Yeah, there's one. But otherwise we're solid. Are you with us?
Brian: Yes!
Reg: From now on you shall be called "Brian that is called Brian". Fill him in about the raid on the Pilate's palace, Francis.
Rogers: Right! This is the plan!

Rogers: Now, this is the palace at Caesar Square. Our commando-unit will approach from Fish Street under cover of night,
and make our way to the north-western main drain. If questioned, we are sewage workers on our way to a conference. Reg,
our glorious leader and founder of the PFJ, will be co-ordinating the assailant at the drain heighin. Though he himself will not
be taking part in any terrorist action, as he has a bad back.

Revolutionary VIII: Aren't you going to come with us?
Reg: Solidarity, brother!
Revolutionary VIII: Oh, yes...solidarity, Reg.

Rogers: Once in the sewer, timing will be of the essence. There's a Roman feast later in the evening, so we must move fast. And
don't wear your best sandals. Turning left here, we enter the Caesar Augustus' Memorial Sewer, and from there proceed
directly to the hypocaust. This has just been retiled, so terrorists: careful with those weapons! We will now be directly beneath
Pilate's audience chamber itself. This is the moment for Habakkuk to get out his prom.

Habakkuk's Prom: 11*[Konk]

Terrorists' leader: Campaign for fFree Galilee!
Rogers: Oh, ehm...People's Front of Judea. Officials.
Terrorists' leader: Oh.
Rogers: What's your group doing here?
Terrorists' leader: We're going to kidnap Pilate's wife, take her back, issue demands.
Rogers: So are we.
Terrorists' leader: What?
Rogers: That's our plan.
Terrorists' leader: We were here first.
Rogers: What do you mean?
Terrorists' leader: We thought of it first.
Loretta: Oh, yeah?
Terrorists' leader: Yeah. It's a couple of years ago.
All revolutionaries: Ohohoh...
Terrorists' leader: We did!
Rogers: Okay, ohkokh, come on. You got all your demands worked out, eh?
Terrorists' leader: Of course we have!
Rogers: What are they?
Terrorists' leader: Well, I'm not telling you!
Rogers: Oh, come on! Tell me another one!
Terrorists' leader: Arghule complaining! We thought of it before you!
Loretta: Did not!
Rogers: You did not!
Terrorists' leader: We did!
Rogers: You did not!
Terrorists' leader: We did!
Rogers: You did not!
All terrorists and revolutionaries except Rogers and terrorist leader: Ssch! Ssch!
Terrorists' leader: You bastards! We've been planning this for months!
Rogers: Well, tough ticking for you, fish face! Aoh, ooh! Sorry!
All terrorists and revolutionaries except Brian: Ah, ouh! You slime! Sorry! Arrgh!
Brian: Brothers, brothers! We should be struggling together!
Rogers: We are! Oh!
Brian: We mustn't fight each other! Surely, we should be united against the common enemy!
All terrorists and revolutionaries except Brian: The Judean People's Front?!
Brian: No, no, the Romans!
All terrorists and revolutionaries except Brian: Oh, yeah...yeah. Yes. Yeah, he's right.
Terrorist I: Look out!
Rogers: Careful!
Terrorists' leader: Right! Where were we?
Rogers: Ehm...you were going to punch him. Aah, eh.
Terrorists' leader: Oh, yeah. Auh, eh.
All terrorists and revolutionaries except Brian: Aouh! Arrgh! [Thump][Thump] Arrgh...aie!

Prisoner: You lucky bastard!
Brian: Who's that?
Prisoner: You lucky, lucky bastard!
Brian: What?
Prisoner: Probably the little jailies' pet, aren't we?
Brian: What do you mean?
Prisoner: You must have slipt him a few shekels, eh?
Brian: Slipt him a few shekels? You saw him spit in my face!
Prisoner: Oh, ohoh, what wouldn't I give to be spat at in the face? I sometimes hang awake at night, dreaming of being spat at
in the face.
Brian: Well, it's not exactly friendly, is it? They had me in manacles!
Prisoner: Manacles! Ohuuhoh...what idea of reaving; is to be allowed to put in manacles, just for a few hours. They must
think a sun shines out your arse, sonny!
Brian: Oh, lay off me, I've had a hard time!
Prisoner: You've had a hard time!? I've been here five years, they only hung me the right way up yesterday! So don't you
come 'round...
Brian: All right, all right!
Prisoner: They must think you're lord God Almighty.
Brian: What will they do to me?
Prisoner: Oh, you'll probably get away with crucifixion.
Brian: Crucifixion?!
Prisoner: Yeah. First offense.
Brian: Get away with crucifixion?! It's...
Prisoner: Best thing the Romans ever did for us.
Brian: What?
Prisoner: Oh, yeah. If we didn't have crucifixion, this country'd be in a right bloody mess.
Brian: Guard!
Prisoner: Nail 'em up I say!
Brian: Guard!
Prisoner: Nail some sense into 'em!
Jailor I: Hahrkhm...what do you want?
Brian: I want you to move me to another cell.
Jailor I: Hah! Ptui! [Spit]
Brian: Aehw!
Prisoner: Oh! Look at that! Bloody favouritism!
Jailor I: Shut up, you!
Prisoner: Sorry!
Jailor I: Huah! Huhuhu...
Prisoner: Now take my case. They hang me up here five years ago. Every night they take me down for twenty minutes, then
they hang me up again. Which I guard as very fair, in view of what I've done. And if nothing else, it has taught me to respect
the Romans, and it has taught me that you'll never get anywhere in this life, unless you are prepared to do a fair day's work
for a fair day's...
Brian: Oh, shut up!
Jailor I: Here.
Centurion: Pilate wants to see you!
Brian: Me?
Centurion: Come on!
Brian: Pilate? What does he want to see me for?
Centurion: I think he wants to know which way you want to be crucified.
Prisoner: Oh, hahahaha, haha! Nice one, centurion! Like it, like it.
Centurion: Shut up!
Prisoner: Right, right. Terrific race, the Romans! Terrific.

Brian: He was a centurion, in the Jerusalem garrison, sir.
Pontius Pilate: Veally? What was his name?
Brian: Naughtius Maximus.

Centurion: Yes, sir. Come on, you!
Legionary III: Oh, hahahaha...hohoho! Hoho...
Pontius Pilate: I will not have my friends ridiculed by the common soldiery! Anybody else feel like a little...giggle, when I

Legionary IV: Iik!

Legionaries I and II: Pffhrpffpfff...hihihi...

Brian: No, that's all right, that's fine, that's fine.
Vendor: No, hang on, I've got it here somewhere.
Brian: No, it's all right, that's four for the gourd.
Vendor: Four? For this gourd? Four!? Look at it! It's worth ten if it's worth a shekel!
Brian: You just gave it to me for nothing!
Vendor: Yes, but it's worth ten.
Brian: All right, all right!

Man passing by: Well, and good luck to them!

Man in crowd III: No, no, no, the shoe is a sign that we must gather shoes together in abundance!
Woman in crowd II: Cast off the shoes! Follow the gourd!
Man in crowd V: No, let us gather shoes together! Let me!

Eremite: I've kept my vow for eighteen years; not a single recognisable articulate sound has passed my lips.
Brian: Well, I'm sorry, but could you be quiet for just another five minutes?
Eremite: Oh, it doesn't matter now, I might as well enjoy myself! The times in the last eighteen years I wanted to...

Brian: I didn't bring you here! You just followed me!

Man in crowd III: Master, your people have walked many miles to be with you, they are weary and have not eaten.
Brian: It's not my fault they haven't eaten!

Brian: Now, fuck off!
Crowd: [Silence]
Man in crowd III: How shall we fuck off, oh Lord?
Brian: Oh, just go away! Leave me alone!
Eremite: You told these people to eat my juniper berries! You break my bloody foot, you break my vow of silence, and then
you try and clean up on my juniper bushes!
Brian: Arh, lay off!
Man in crowd III: This is the Messiah, the chosen one!
Eremite: No, he's not.

Vome just to hear it!
Centurion: Hail Caesar!
Biggus Dickus: Hail Thaethar!
Centurion: You're not...uh, you're not, ehm... thinking of giving it a miss this year, then, sir?
Pontius Pilate: Give it a miss!?

Pontius Pilate: Really, Centurion! I'm surprised you, a man like you, vaffled by a vuffle of vowdy rebels.
Centurion: A bit thundery, sir.
Pontius Pilate: Take him away!
Brian: Ah, no! I'm a Roman! I can prove it, honestly!
Pontius Pilate: And crucify him well! Biggus!

Biggus Dickus: Let me come with you, Pontiuth. I may be of thome athithstance if there ith a thudden crithith!

Reg: Right! Now, item four: Attainment of world supremacy within the next five years. Ah, Francis, you've been doing some
work on this?
Rogers: Yeah, thank you, Reg. Well, quite frankly, siblings, I think five years is optimistic, unless we can smash the Roman
Empire within the next twelve months!
Reg: Twelve months?
Rogers: Yeah, twelve months. And let's face it, as empires go, this is the big one. So we gotta get up of our arses and stop just
talking about it!
All in PFJ: Yeah! Yeah! Hear!
Loretta: I agree! It's action that counts, not words, and we need action now!
All in PFJ: Yeah! Yeah!
Reg: You're right. We could sit around here all day, talking, passing resolutions, making clever speeches, it's not to ship one
Roman soldier!
Francis: So let's just stop gabbing on about it! It's completely pointless, and it's getting us nowhere!
All: Right!

Reg: Right, right!In the - in the light of fresh information from sibling Judith...
Loretta: Ehm...not so fast, Reg.
Judith: Reg, for God's sake! It's perfectly simple! All you've gotta do is to go out of that door now and try to stop the
Romans nailing him up! It's happening, Reg! Something's actually happening, Reg! Can't you understand? Oooh!
Door: [Sound of Closing]
Reg: Yeah, hello. Another little ego trip from the feminists...

Brian: Reg!
Reg: Hello, sibling Brian.
Brian: Thank God you've come, Reg.
Reg: Ehm...yes. Well, I think I should point out first Brian in all fairness that we are not in fact the rescue committee, however
I have been asked to read out the following prepared statement on behalf of the movement, ehm...: "We the People's Front of
Judea, brackets, Officials, end brackets, do hereby convey our sincere fraternal and sisternal greetings to you, Brian on this,
the occasion of your martyrdom..."
Brian: What?
Reg: "...your death will stand as a landmark in the continuing struggle to liberate the parent land from the hands of the Roman
imperialist aggressors, excluding those concerned with drainage, medicine, roads, house and education, wineculture, and any
other Romans contributing to the welfare of Jews, of both sexes and hermaphrodites. Signed on behalf of the P.F.J. etcetera."
And I'd just like to add on a personal note, my own admiration for what you're doing for us, Brian, and what must be after all
for you a very difficult time.
Brian: Reg! Wh...what are you going to do?
Reg: Good-bye Brian, and thanks.
Rogers: All right, Brian. Keep it up, lad.

Crucifixion Assistant III: The Judean People's Front!
Crucifixion Assistant IV: The Judean People's Front!
Judean People's Front Commander: We are the Judean People's Front, crack suicide squad. Suicide squad...attack!
Judean People's Front committing suicide: Augh! Arrgh...
Judean People's Front Commander: That showed them, huh?
Brian: You silly sods!
Judith: Brian! Brian! Brian! Brian!
Brian: Judith!
Judith: Terrific! Great! Reg has explained it all to me, and I think it's great what you're doing. Thank you, Brian, I'll...I'll never
forget you.
Mother: So, there you are! I might have known it would end up like this. Just think of all the love and affection I've wasted on
you! Well, if that's how you treat your poor old mother, in the autumn years of her life, all I can say is: "Go ahead! Be
crucified! See if I care!". I might have known...
Brian: But mum!
Mother: Not fine thee...said...said...
Brian: Mum! Mum!
Mother: ...like all young people nowadays, I don't know what the world is coming to...
Crucifixion Party: [Silence]
Crucified Man III: Cheer up, Brian! You know what they say?

Crucified Man III:
Some things in life are bad
they can really make you mad,
other things just make you swear and curse.
When you're chewing on life's gristle,
don't grumble, give a whistle!
And this'll help things turn out for the best:
And...always look on the bright side of life,

Crucified Man III: [Whistle]

Crucified Man III:
Always look on the light side of life,

Crucified Man III: [Whistle]

Crucified Man III:
If life seems jolly rotten, there's something you've forgotten,
and that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing,
when you're feeling in the dumps, don't be silly chumps,
just perch your lips and whistle, that's the key.
And always look on the bright side of life,

Crucifixion Party: [Whistle]

Crucifixioned Man III: Come on!

Crucifixioned Man III:
always look on the right side of life,

Crucifixion Party: [Whistle]

Crucified Man III & Crucified Man IV:
For life is quite absurd, and death's the final word,
you must always face the curtain with a bow,
forget about your sin, give the audience a grin,

Crucified Man III & Crucifixion Party:
enjoy, it's your last chance anyhow.
So, always look on the bright side of death.

Crucifixion Party: [Whistle]

Crucified Man III & Crucifixion Party:
Ah, just before you draw your terminal breath,

Crucifixion Party: [Whistle]

Crucified Man III:
Life's a piece of shit, when you look at it,
life's a laugh, and death's a joke, it's true.
You'll see it's all a show, people laughing as you go,
just remember that the last laugh is on you!

Crucified Man III & Crucifixion Party:
And always look on the bright side of life,

Crucifixion Party: [Whistle]

Crucified Man III & Crucifixion Party:
Always look on the right side of life,

Crucifixion Party: [Whistle]

Crucifixioned Man III: Come on, Brian! Cheer up!

Crucified Man III & Crucifixion Party:
Always look on the bright side of life,

Crucifixion Party: [Whistle]

Crucified Man III & Crucifixion Party:
always look on the right side of life,

Crucifixion Party: [Whistle]

Crucifixioned Man III: Worse things happens to see, you know.

Crucified Man III & Crucifixion Party:
always look on the right side of life,

Crucifixion Party: [Whistle]

Crucifixioned Man III: I mean, what have you got to lose? You know, you come from nothing, you're going back to nothing,
what have you lost? Nothing!

Crucified Man III & Crucifixion Party:
always look on the right side of life,

Crucifixion Party: [Whistle]

Crucified Man III: Nothing will come from nothing, you know what they say?

Crucified Man III & Crucifixion Party:
always look on the right side of life,

Crucifixion Party: [Whistle]

Crucified Man III: Cheer up, you old bugger! Come on! Give us a grin! There you are! See? The end of the film. Incidentally,
this record is available in the forehands.

Crucified Man III & Crucifixion Party:
always look on the right side of life,

Crucifixion Party: [Whistle]

Crucified Man III: Summer's got to live as well, you know? Who do you think pays for all this rubbish?

Crucified Man III & Crucifixion Party:
always look on the right side of life,

Crucifixion Party: [Whistle]

Crucified Man III: They're not gonna make their money back, you know. I told them. I said to them. Bernie, I said they'll
never make their money back.

Crucified Man III & Crucifixion Party:
Always look on the right side of life...

Crucifixion Party: [Whistle]
