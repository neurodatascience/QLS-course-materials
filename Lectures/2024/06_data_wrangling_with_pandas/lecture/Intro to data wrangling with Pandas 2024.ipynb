    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### a) What is Pandas?\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Software Library for Python](https://pandas.pydata.org/) (not a [bear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_panda), [extra-cute bear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_panda), or [Kung Fu bear](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODJkZTZhMWItMDI3Yy00ZWZlLTk4NjQtOTI1ZjU5NjBjZTVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODE5NzE3OTE@._V1_.jpg), contrary to popular belief).\n",
    "* Data strutures and functions to manipulate data in tables and time series\n",
    "* Built on top of NumPy (Recall...Large, multi-dimensional arrays & matrices, with mathematical functions to operate on these arrays).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### b) (Very) Brief history\n",
    "\n",
    "* Development started in 2008 by Wes McKinney at AQR Capital (a global investment management firm).\n",
    "* They needed a tool to perform quantitative analyses on financial data.\n",
    "* Name is from \"Panel Data\" (Econometrics term: multidimensional data involving measurements for the same subject over time)\n",
    "* Went Open Source in 2009.\n",
    "* Official book [(HTML link)](https://wesmckinney.com/book/) was published in 2012, and more developers started joining.\n",
    "* 2013 and onwards: started gathering serious momentum in the Python userbase, got sponsored, etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "### c) Why/When Pandas?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python: Huge growth since 2012 & uptake in academic settings.\n",
    "* Popular tool with an active community of contributors - keep it in good shape.\n",
    "* Well-documented:\n",
    "  * [Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/), with tutorials and API reference\n",
    "  * Official book [(HTML link)](https://wesmckinney.com/book/) \n",
    "  * Plenty of StackOverflow threads, books [(A good HTML one)](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/index.html), online guides, tutorials, etc..\n",
    "* Rich, user-friendly API.\n",
    "* Effective tool for data exploration.\n",
    "* Computationally faster and less of a headache than straightforward approaches (eg: your 'for' loops and Python Lists) due to NumPy arrays being implemented in C.\n",
    "  * BUT...Not very fast compared to many database-like tools popular in open-source data science, which you'll want when your table is huge.\n",
    "  * For tables larger than your machine's memory you might want to check out other libraries or softwares, a few are benchmarked [here](https://h2oai.github.io/db-benchmark/).\n",
    "  * Pandas is meant for 2D tables, for labelled multi-dimensional arrays check out [xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/).\n",
    "  \n",
    "### d) Reference & Further Reading\n",
    "\n",
    "* This module is partially based on the free [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/index.html). For a more in-depth coverage of Pandas (and a few of the other course modules) I highly recommend checking it out!\n",
    "* We also like the [Neurohackademy lecture](https://neurohackademy.org/course/complex-data-structures/) on Pandas."
