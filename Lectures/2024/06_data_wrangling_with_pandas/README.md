This module is designed to introduce students to the Pandas Python library
for manipulating data in tables and time series (sorry for the misleading bear pictures).
It aims to build a basic understanding of what happens underneath the hood of Pandas,
and arm you with the essential practical knowledge
to fearlessly tackle the next CSV file you encounter in the wild.
