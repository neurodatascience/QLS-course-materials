# Containers

Hi, welcome to the lecture on Containers.

In this module we will talk about different options
to isolate the environment in which you run your code and it's dependencies.

We will talk about why isolating environments is a good practice
to make your code reproducible and shareable.

And we'll also do some simple hands-on examples of
how to work with Python Virtual Environments and Docker Containers.
