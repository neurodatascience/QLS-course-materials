# Exercise 4: Put both your figures in subplots in the same figure

## Goal
In the last two exercises, you created a plot of summary statistics and a corresponding plot with all the participant data available. 
In this exercise, you will put both of those figures in the same subplot. 

## Data
- [`../../data/ABIDE_paper_table_1.png`](../../data/ABIDE_paper_table_1.png) contains an image of the table with the summary statistics
- [`../../data/participants_nbsub-200.tsv`](../../data/participants_nbsub-200.tsv) contains the participant-level data from the ABIDE dataset
- [`../../data/ABIDE_LEGEND_V1.02.pdf`](../../data/ABIDE_LEGEND_V1.02.pdf) contains a table with the meanings of the column names in the .tsv

## Task
1. Combine your code from the past two tasks so they're in the same figure, in separate subplots.
