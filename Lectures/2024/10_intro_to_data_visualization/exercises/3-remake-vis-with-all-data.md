# Exercise 3: Remake your visualization with all the data
(not just the summary statistics)

## Goal
In the last two exercises, you planned and created a figure using summary statistics from a table.
In this exercise, you will re-design and encode your figure from exercise 1, with all the participant-level data. 

## Data
- [`../../data/participants_nbsub-200.tsv`](../../data/participants_nbsub-200.tsv) contains the participant-level data from the ABIDE dataset
- [`../../data/ABIDE_LEGEND_V1.02.pdf`](../../data/ABIDE_LEGEND_V1.02.pdf) contains a table with the meanings of the column names in the .tsv

## Task
1. Plan whether/how to change your figure 
2. Write a python script to create the figure
