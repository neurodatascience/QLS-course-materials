# Containers

**Instructor**: Alyssa

In this module, we'll learn about different options to isolate the environment in which you run your code/software tools and their dependencies, including:
- Why isolating environments is good practice for making code reproducible and shareable
- Why containers are useful
- Basics of working with Docker containers, using some hands-on examples

## Requirements

For this module, you will need:
- Docker
- A terminal running Bash
- The files in the [data](../data) folder (you'll receive step-by-step instructions on cloning this repo to your computer during the installation clinic)
- A computer with internet access

If you followed the [course setup](https://neurodatascience.github.io/QLS612-Overview/setup/setup.html) instructions, you should already be good to go!
