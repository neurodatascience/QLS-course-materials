# 6. Data Preprocessing in Python

**Instructor:** Nadia Blostein

This module is designed to introduce students to data preprocessing (ie preparation) in Python. Data preprocessing is a critical prerequisite to any data analysis or machine learning application. Students will be preprocessing .csv and .png data from the [following repository](https://github.com/NadiaBlostein/Open-Access-HCP-Data) and the session will cover the topics below:

**Outline** 
1. Load and examine your data
2. Data reformatting
3. Data filtering
4. Data transforms
5. Data visualization
6. Examining and manipulating 2D images with scikit image and scipy

**Questions you will be able to answer after taking this module:** 

1. What is a problem that can arise when you one-hot encode a feature with a lot of categories?
2. What Python library can you use to generate histograms?
3. If you are using a Gaussian filter to blur an image, which of the following $\sigma$ values will blur your image the most: 0.1, 2, 4, 5, 6 ?
4. What Python package is faster for matrix computations: Pandas or Numpy?
