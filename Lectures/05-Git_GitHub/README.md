# Introduction to git and GitHub

Hello! 👋 

Git and GitHub are key tools for doing version control in both academia and industry. These tools can help researchers do more efficient, open, and reproducible work. In this material, we cover these topics:

* What is distributed version control?
* Why has it become so important in science and industry?;
* How to track your own work using Git; and
* How to share your work and collaborate with GitHub.
