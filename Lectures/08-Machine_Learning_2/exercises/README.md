# Machine learning part 2: validation and model selection

This directory contains the exercises we will use during the in-class tutorial for the Intro to Machine Learning part 2 module.

Files contain an incomplete python script that we will complete and run.
If you want to edit jupyter notebooks rather than python programs, you can use the notebooks in the `notebooks` directory -- they contain the same instructions and code.

@maintainers: `*_questions.py` files are automatically generated, don't edit them!
